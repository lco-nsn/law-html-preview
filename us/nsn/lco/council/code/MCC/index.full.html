                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government, relating to the grant of pardons or forgiveness to individuals upon demonstration of full rehabilitation, trustworthiness and/or commitment to lawful behavior. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(m)" title="">Article V, § 1 (m)</a> and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(s)" title="">(s)</a> of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Band any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers," <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(m)" title="">Article V, § 1 (m)</a>; and "promulgate and enforce ordinances...providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice..." <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(s)" title="">Article V, § 1 (s)</a>. Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby recognizes that the purpose of this ordinance is to provide a fair, efficient and formal process by which: (a) a Tribal Member may receive a pardon for the conviction of a crime(s); or (b) a Tribal Member or non-Tribal Member may receive forgiveness for acts that render him or her ineligible for Tribal employment; an occupational license, certification, or permit issued by the Tribe; a foster care license issued by the Tribe; or other Tribal benefit.</p>
