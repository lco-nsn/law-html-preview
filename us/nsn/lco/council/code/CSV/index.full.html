                  <strong>Preamble</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Hunting, fishing and gathering has always been central to the Ojibwe way of life. As such, it is important that this ordinance fulfills two equally important goals. First, it must preserve <em>gidizhitwaawininaan</em> (our traditions and customs). Second, it must regulate the modern realities of hunting, fishing and gathering that our ancestors did not have to contemplate, such as ensuring Tribal members' safety from gunfire in residential areas. In order to ensure that this ordinance is interpreted in the spirit of <em>gidizhitwaawininaan</em>, statements of tradition and custom are placed throughout this ordinance. It is hoped that these statements will help to both preserve our past and provide guidance and education for our future.</p>

                  <strong>Tradition and Custom</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Hunting provided the means for our ancestors' survival. The meat provided us with food, the bones with tools, and the hides with clothing.</p>
                <p>But hunting is more than just a functional activity for the Ojibwe people; it is a way of life, which is marked by great respect and appreciation for all life.</p>
                <p>Our stories illustrate our values surrounding hunting. Included here are two stories.</p>
                <p>First is the story of Mother Earth's fall to Earth and how the animals saved her and taught her to respect them.</p>
                <p>Second is the story of the first Indian man and woman and how we chose hunting for our way of life.</p>
                <p>When the Morning Star asked Mother Earth to be his wife and live with him in the sky world, he cautioned her that she must follow one rule: she must never look down on the earth.</p>
                <p>If she did, she would become homesick and have to be returned to earth. Mother Earth promised to not look at the earth and went to live with Morning Star, the Sun and the Moon in their rainbow wigwam in the sky world.</p>
                <p>When they got to the sky world, Morning Star covered the doorway to the earth with a large stone and plants around the doorway to help Mother Earth keep her promise to him.</p>
                <p>One day, when Mother Earth was left alone in the sky world, she got her digging stick and went to look for food. She wandered to where the doorway to the earth was and began to gather plants. Mother Earth was not careful in her digging though and dug up so many plants that she saw through to the earth.</p>
                <p>As Morning Star warned, she became homesick and began to cry. The Sun, Moon and Morning Star heard her cries and rushed to her, as they loved her. When Morning Star discovered what had happened, he said: "Even though I love you and you are carrying my child, I must drop you back to Earth." And so he did.</p>
                <p>As Mother Earth fell through the sky down to earth, she yelled and cried in fear for she knew she could not survive. The swans and geese on earth heard her cries and flew to her in the sky.</p>
                <p>Mother Earth landed softly on their back, and they took her safely down to earth.</p>
                <p>When Mother Earth landed, the deer came to her and said: "The Great Spirit said one day that there would be Indian people, and we were to give our lives to them. In return, you must have a feast to give thanks when you take our life to thank the Great Spirit for creating us and the deer spirit for giving his life up for you. You must never waste meat or take more than you need.</p>
                <p>If you do these things, you will have good luck and all the Indian people will benefit, as you will have meat in abundance." This is how the rules of hunting were first established for the Indian people.</p>
                <p>When the Great Spirit created the first Indian man from the ribs of the first Indian woman, the deer and bear spirits were present. They placed next to the man a pipe, tobacco and a bow and arrow.</p>
                <p>The Great Spirit then took a miigis shell and blew the breath of life into the Indian man and woman. Before the Indian man and woman awoke, the Great Spirit, the Bear Spirit and the Deer Spirit hid, so as to not frighten the Indian man and woman.</p>
                <p>When the man awoke, he took the bow and arrow, tested it, and he liked it. The Great Spirit spoke into the man's mind: "Because you picked up the bow and arrow; that is the life style that you have chosen." This is why our hunting and fishing rights could not be traded away in treaties; they are god given rights.</p>

                  <p>Â§CSV.1.3.290 was formerly codified as VI LCOTCL Â§1.329</p>
                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p><strong><em>Niiyawe'enh</em></strong> â refers to <em>niiyaw</em> (body) which carries the critical meaning of the word for namesake. When someone gave a name, the name giver gave part of his or her spirit essence and put it into the body of the name recipient, making them spiritually related for life. The name giver then functioned more like a godparent in Christian tradition, as a spiritually connected family member blessed with the same dream or vision that informed the given name. The term niiyawe'enh is used reciprocally and is shortened in some communities to just <em>we'enh</em>, but still retaining the cultural and spiritual value. Sources for information on naming include: Anton Treuer, <em>The Assassination of Hole in the Day</em>, (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2010), pg. 13; Edward Benton-Benai, <em>The Mishomis Book: The Voice of the Ojibway</em>, (Hayward, WI: Indian Country Communications, Inc., 1988), Chapter 2, Original Man Walks the Earth, pgs. 5-9; Basil Johnston, <em>Ojibway Heritage</em>, (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), Chapter 11, Ceremonies, Songs and Dances (Life Commemorations), pgs. 141-148; Basil Johnston, Ojibway Ceremonies, (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), "The Naming Ceremony: Wauweendaussowin," pgs. 11-30; Frances Densmore, <em>Chippewa Customs</em>, Washington: Bulletin, Bureau of American Ethnology, 1929), "The Naming of a Child," pgs. 52-58; Amik Larry Smallwood, <em>Ojibwe Names are Spirit Names</em>, (Onamia,MN: Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, 2009), pgs. 1-2. </p>
                  <p><strong><em>Doodem</em></strong> â refers to <em>ode'</em> (heart) and <em>doodoosh</em> (from where one gets their sustenance) which establishes the word for clan. Ojibwe stories commonly acknowledge animals as teachers and guides to Original Man, or Anishinaabe. They taught him many valuable lessons as he became acquainted with his environment. They showed him various plants for use as food, medicine, in ceremonies and for utilitarian purposes. They showed him how to hunt and fish and most important of all, they provided themselves to Anishinaabe for food, clothing, and shelter. The Ojibwe at one time were not relating to <em>aki</em>, the earth in a way that properly accounted for these pre-existing relationships. They had created great imbalance and the Earth was flooded. When the Earth was created anew, the animals stood up for the people, they vouched for the Ojibwe and said they would teach them how to relate to creation. The animals created a relationship with the Ojibwe and took responsibility for their actions. This is one of the origin stories of the <em>doodem</em> (clan) system. This system uses various animals as symbols for the clans. The animals' characteristics provide an identity and define roles and responsibilities for members of each <em>doodem</em>. The <em>Doodem</em> becomes another form of family for Ojibwe people. <em>Doodem</em> identity is passed through the father. Members of the same <em>doodem</em>, no matter how many miles apart, were one's brothers and sisters and were expected to extend hospitality, food and lodging to each other. Since Ojibwe people belong to a tribe (band) and to the Ojibwe Nation, <em>doodem</em> relationships help unite the various Ojibwe tribes as one nation. Sources for information on clans include: Edward Benton-Benai, <em>The Mishomis Book: The Voice of the Ojibway</em>, (Hayward, WI: Indian Country Communications, Inc., 1988), Chapter 10, The Clan System, pgs. 74-78; Ruth Landes, <em>Ojibwa Sociology</em>, (NY: Columbia University Contributions to Anthropology, 1969), Chapter 2, "Gens Organization," pgs. 31-52; William W. Warren, <em>History of the Ojibway People</em>, (St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1984), Chapter 2, "Totemic Division of the Ojibways," pgs. 41-53; Basil Johnston, <em>Ojibway Heritage</em>, (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), Chapter 5, "Man's World," pgs. 59-79; James Dumont, <em>Anishinaabe Izhichigewin</em>, (1999), Chapter 1, Part Four "The Anishinaabe Clan System as a Model of Governance," pgs. 27-36, Chapter 1, Part Five, "Anishinaabe Principles of Leadership and Managing Change," pgs. 36-42; Heidi Bohaker, "Reading Anishinaabe Identities: Meaning and Metaphor in Nindoodem Pictographs," <em>Ethnohistory</em>, vol. 57, no. 1 (Winter 2010): 11-33; Heidi Bohaker, "Nindoodemag: The Signifigance of Algonquian Kinship Networks in the Eastern Great Lakes Region, 1600-1701," <em>William and Mary Quarterly</em>, vol. 63, no. 1 (January 2006): 23-49.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Bami'aagaan</em></strong> â refers to <em>bami'</em> (provide for, nurture, look after, support, adopt) which establishes the word for the adopted one. Customary adoption is a traditional tribal practice recognized by the community and tribe which acknowledges a person as having established a permanent kinship relationship such as parent/child, brother/sister, or grandparent/grandchild, with someone other than the person's blood relative. It is the fundamental belief of the Ojibwe that the people of the communities are the sacred responsibility of the Tribe. This is because one of the basic inherent sovereign rights of the Tribe is the right to make decisions regarding the best interests of their communities including who should provide for the care, nourishment and support of their members. This provision is intended to acknowledge these safe, stable, nurturing, and permanent relationships established pursuant to tribal customary practices regarding the tribe's members in order to provide for the protection of their people and way of life. The principles that guide decisions pertaining to <em>bami'aagan</em> are: protection of the member's well-being and welfare and their sense of belonging; preservation of the member's identity as a tribal member and member of an extended family and clan; as well as the preservation of the culture, religion, language, values, clan system and relationships of the Tribe. Sources for information on traditional kinship responsibilities and customary adoption include: White Earth Band of Ojibwe, <em>Title 4(a) Customary Adoption Code</em>; Ruth Landes, <em>Ojibwa Sociology</em>, (NY: Columbia University Contributions to Anthropology, 1969), Chapter 2, "Kinship Organization," pgs. 5-30; Heidi Kiiwetinipinesiik Stark, "Marked by Fire: Anishinaabe Articulations of Nationhood in Treaty Making with the United States and Canada," <em>American Indian Quarterly</em>, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 119-149.</p>

                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p>Wild Rice Teaching by Bawdwaywidun (Eddie Benton) from Dibaajimowinan: Anishinaabe Stories of Culture and Respect, Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WI: July 2013.</p>
                  <p>As the Anishinaabe was told before the white man arrived. There were seven spirits that came to tell the Anishinaabe about what was going to happen with the coming of the white man. These are the teachings that were given that I am going to talk about. The Anishinaabe did not walk away from it. They gathered all the mide teachings, the objects they used such as our grandfather drum, our rattles, mide items and all that is used for the midewiwin. They lifted their sacred items and they all left from there together before the Menominee Indians left, the ones that are known as such they were given the rice, the sacred rice that is called the anishinaabe was told to travel towards the west. As you arrive where it stands, where it lays in the water that sacred rice. This is where you will know the land that is for the Indian will be. This is what they were told. The Menominee where the first to bring the rice (to usâ¦). It was in a sack, as we know of it.</p>
                  <p>Then in birch bark and the songs, spirit songs and the wild rice bird that is called. That wild rice bird, that same one that flew up with the spirits as they were leaving. As they come and check it out, looked at it. And this is how we still know it. This sacred food, the spirit put it here for the Indian, for the Ojibwe, for the Potawatomie and the Odawa and the Menominee and the Shawnee that are called. And also the Kickapoo Indians that are called as such. This is spirit food that was given by the spirit. This is where it came from, you will not find anywhere else, that which was given to the Anishinaabe. The Anishinaabe was told to take care of the rice and the rice will take care of you. The rice will never disappear as long as you take great care of it. And also offer your tobacco before you get into a canoe. Someone will speak to the spiritâ¦that spirit that is in the water. This is the one that you speak to before you get into the canoe. As we proceed to pick riceâ¦you shall respect all things. This is what we were told. Always remember the spirit, never forget the spirit.</p>
                  <p>The creator is the one that put this rice to be growing here on earth. That is why we offer tobacco so that we carry on these sacred teachings. To know these teachings, not only to think about it but to know it, not any ole way, not to think about them in any ole way, but to really know the teachings, this is what we were told. That is why tobacco is used before the rice is picked. This where we give our thanks for the sacredness of the rice, as we give thanks. This where we give our thanks to take care of and to make it we are not doing enough to take care of it, we don't give enough voice to it. We do not waste any of it, we take great care of it so that we can feed our children, so that we can feed the ones that are hungry.</p>
                  <p>As I give these teachings, I want this to be carried on so that the Anishinaabe will know this that was given as we take care of the sacredness of the food. We lead a good life when we remember the sacred teachings that we were given. I wish my teaching to be carried on to those that hear this. I do not do this for nothing.

                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p>Big Game Tradition and Custom</p>
                  <p>There once was an Indian village by a wild rice lake that did not want for anything. The people there only took what they needed and always had feasts to give thanks.</p>
                  <p>As time went on, though, the people began to forget their traditions. Soon, the fish were not as abundant and their gardens were not as fruitful. Then, the deer disappeared, and the people began to starve.</p>
                  <p>A man sat down and began to think about what went wrong. He saw that the ravens and crows were leaving and thought that they were leading the deer away. So, the man began to fast and follow the ravens and crows north.</p>
                  <p>The further he traveled, his body got weaker. Finally, he fell over and lost consciousness, but his soul continued the journey northward, with the clan spirits watching over it. He came across a forest where the ravens and crows had gathered.</p>
                  <p>He asked them, "Why did you take the deer from us? We rely on them for our food and clothing." The ravens replied: "No, it was not us. We rely on the deer for our lives, so we followed the deer when they left. You were wasteful. You owe the deer people an apology, so we will let you through."</p>
                  <p>The man continued on and came upon deer in a field. He approached the Boss Deer and began to cry. The Boss Deer told him that it was man's fault that the deer had left. The man begged the Boss Deer to come back to his people.</p>
                  <p>He promised to go back to his people and teach them to correct their ways. The deer were so moved by the man's sacrifice for his people, they agreed to come back. With this promise, the man's soul returned to his body and when he awoke, the deer had come back.</p>
                  <p>From then on though, the deer will disappear every year at the end of August in order to discuss which Indian hunters have respected their ways and which have not. Those who have will always find deer and prosper.</p>

                  <p>Bears Tradition and Custom</p>
                  <p>Bears are given great respect, as they are the only animal who can stand on two feet, similar to humans.</p>
                  <p>The bear is the protector of the Earth, Tribe and Burial Grounds. Before taking a bear's life, permission was requested from the Bear Clan. After a bear was killed, a feast was held in honor of the bear and the Bear Clan.</p>
                  <p>All parts of the bear were used and nothing was wasted: meat for food, fat and entrails for medicine and water containers, and bear paws were used for the fourth degree member of the medicine lodge.</p>
                  <p>However, only Bear Clan members were allowed to use the non-meat part of the bear.  The bear's skull was placed on a bear trail, facing west. It is believed that the bear would then be reborn.</p>

                  <p>As with big game, a first kill feast was the tradition when hunting small game. Each animal had its own use and stories.</p>
                  <p>For example, rabbit skins were used to make diapers. Porcupines could only be hunted if there was extreme need. The beaver requested that when their lives were taken, their bones were to be thrown back in the water, where they will turn into another beaver.</p>
                  <p>By following this request, there would always be an abundance of beaver.</p>

                  <p>Fish Tradition and Custom, Excerpt from Mii-Gaa-Onji-Bapiba'iwed Anishinaabe Mewinzha by Amik (Larry Smallwood) from Dibaajimowinan: Anishinaabe Stories of Culture and Respect, Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WI: July 2013.</p>
                  <p>And then in the summertime, before the summer, when the ice would leave, tha'ts when they would go out spearing again on the lake, and they sets nets also. They got a lot of fish from netting. Over in Mille Lacs Lake, over there that is an especially big lake where they set nets. They made their nets carefully. See, the Mille Lacs Anishinaabe always say, "You don't let your net touch the bare ground; treat your net with respect." That's why they always hung up their nets carefully and checked their nets right away, put their nets in a box and also their fish so that they wouldn't drag them on the bare ground. As for today, you see Anishinaabe from different places dragging their nets around on the road and the bare ground, going around disrespecting their nets. It is from there that we get our food from setting nets.</p>

                <p>It is the policy of the Tribal Governing Board to allow members to bid exclusively on timber sales involving approximately 250 acres of trust land.  Since the adoption of this policy, members have raised concerns about the potential of abuse of this benefit if a member bid on a sale in name only and if awarded, would not be significantly involved in other aspects of the timber sale.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to deter and eliminate members from bidding on sales in name only.  It is in the best interest of members to be directly involved in timber sales so that they benefit the most financially from timber sales.</p>
                <p>MEMBERS FRONTING FOR NON-INDIAN PERSONS OR COMPANIES OR NON-LCO TRIBAL MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A TIMBER SALE CONTRACT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  THE LCO TRIBAL MEMBER MUST HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.</p>
                <p>This ordinance supersedes, rescinds and takes precedence over any and all previous Timber Harvesting Policies that address member timber sales which may have been adopted by tribal entities, agencies, committees or by the Tribal Governing Board.</p>
                <p>This ordinance shall remain in effect until reviewed and/or revised at the discretion of the Tribal Governing Board.</p>

                  <p>Mitigoog Teaching by Ogimaawigwanebiik (Nancy Jones) from Dibaajimowinan: Anishinaabe Stories of Culture and Respect, Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WI: July 2013. </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Now this tree with needles, the one called white spruce â oops! I just remembered.  First I need to talk about this. All these trees we see in the bush have Indian names. Nanibosh gave them all Indian names when he made the earth. And that is why, that is what I tell them, people. It is very sacred when someone has a spirit name. That is why we were given Anishinaabe names. The spirit gave these to us. The spirit gave us these names so that we can carry them in a sacred manner. That is why they were so sacred, highly honored. That is why. That is how one receives good life when they take care of or honor their name. This is what my late grandmother told to me. If you think about those trees, they all have spirit names. That is why you have a spirit name. This is what my grandmother told me.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>This is what Nanaboozhoo did; he gave all trees names. That is the white spruce that was named. There are a lot of uses for the white spruce. So he (the tree) was asked (by Nanabush), "How are you going to help the Anishinaabe when they get here?" "Oh there is a lot they can use me for," he said. "They might even make medicine out of me; they can use my tree-ness and my needles." "Spruce" apparently is what he is called in the English, when one here to use the English language that is what the white people (French) call them. And I have this one teaching, one of the ways I use the white spruce -when the moose is killed. And this, a certain intestine part of the moose has inside of him, that is what I used. That white spruce, I shrink it (using heat and smoke). I turned it inside out, that certain part of the intestine.  And then I heated up the intestine. I made a fire. And then I put that spruce there. Then on top of that smoky spruce I put that moose intestine to shrink. Does it ever taste good when you do it this way.  (Cultural point. The moose is pleased when all of his parts are eaten. Every part of the moose has a special gift for the woman who is the life giver.)</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then there is the next one. The cedar tree, that was another one that was asked, "How will you help the Anishinaabe?" Nanabosh asked. "Oh there are a lot of ways I can help the Anishinaabe," he said. "When somebody has a child, when a couple has a child, they will use my wood to make the cradle board," he said. "I will give him all the love that I have to offer to the child. I shall bestow many visions onto him for the duration that he is in the cradle board. And he shall dream too. The child will have healthy bones, have a straight spine, strong and straight bones just be totally healthy if one uses the cedar. I have many uses that I can give them, when they want to make medicine from my being a tree. When someone is making a canoe, that is one use that will be used to make the strips of cedar on the bottom when someone makes it. They can make a cedar bark covering for their shelter when they want to stay warm during the winter". That is the one, the cedar bark, that will be utilized for a roof covering. And also these trees they will make other things like rice knockers, how it was said. This is where it will come from. "There are many ways I can help the Anishinaabe. I shall care for them too."</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Next I will talk about the jackpPine. I will also help. That whom they call the jack pine, perhaps is what he is called. "Oh me too, I could help out the Anishinaabe. Me too! I have medicine that the Anishinaabe could use." They will learn more about it (as the world grows.) There is something, one thing, I would like to tell about. For instance these certain partridges the ones called spruce hens. It is these [jackpine] boughs that these spruce hens eat. That is where the Anishinaabe looked for them to go get when he wanted to eat the spruce hen, it is said. The spruce hen is very tame.  "And that is the way I will try to help the Anishinaabe." They are easy to snare the spruce hen whenever they use a snare (on a long stick.) "That is the way that I shall help the Anishinaabe." (Cultural note: The jack pine instructed the spruce hen to make himself available to the Anishinaabe. The spruce hen is not dumb. The jack pine promised Nenabosh that he would help the Anishinaabe, and this is how he is keeping his promise.)</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Then next the balsam tree arrived. It is the balsam tree which is called this way. "Oh me too, I shall help in many ways. For instance, when the Anishinaabe makes camp. They will use my boughs as a floor when they need something to lie on. And for instance these things, the way that I look, (my pitch) it is.  If someone pokes at the lumpy pitch, the blister part of that tree, from there they will get medicine. The medicine they will get from here, and they know later on how to use this medicine. There is a reason why I look like this, when the tree has all this sticky pitch. There are many uses for this (pitch.) They will use this for flooring, and others will use this when they make medicine. They will have dreams as to how to use it, those Anishinaabeg when they arrive."</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And there is another one, the next one. The white pine, the one they call white pine, is what they named it. I did not hear of many uses for this tree. However, it burns very well when used as firewood this pine tree.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then the next one, he is like the others, too. He, too, is medicinal. All the trees that grow there, they are all medicinal trees. It is only â someone will come to know how â how a person would utilize this tree, how it be would used. This is what I was told when I was being instructed in something. You will live and learn about it. Now look at this [red] pine. It is the same this one, when I used to see that tree. When they used to split it up in little pieces (with an ax), and they would saw it up. We used to make play things out of it when we were children. We would bend the needles to make little snowshoes â little snow shoes just like when a child is at play. That is what we did.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Then another one spoke up. "Me too! I carry medicine. Later on the Anishinaabeg will know how to use me," the tree said. And now that white birch tree, he, too, has many uses. This is where a variety of things are made from. For example, as far back as I can remember, I would watch my late father. He would make snowshoes by bending that birch tree. He also made a toboggan. And when he used the bark, he made many things with it. Also the folding birch bark basket, it was said. Also when the Anishinaabe needed something for roofing. I do not remember what it is called (wiigwaasabak), when they sew the birch bark (pieces) together. That is what one would use for roofing material long ago,  even nowadays whenever one wants to make a roof. That is the birch tree that I am talking about.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And now for the poplar tree. Poplar tree is probably the name of it. And he too spoke up."I too have many gifts to help the Anishinaabe." For example when the way that my tree looks and even the smaller trees, this is where the Anishinaabe will get medicine from when they make medicine." I also remember back when I was a child. We would eat the sap from the bark from the poplar tree. We would peel the bark of the tree. This is where we would get it from. Boy, did it ever taste good that one! It was called thick sap. It almost tastse like sugar. That is what we use to go after, later on into the summer. I, we, really liked the taste of it and this is what my late grandmother told me. "You are medicating yourselves when you eat that sap. That is medicine that you are eating" is what she use to tell me. I really liked what she said to me. I would hang out in the woods eating the sap of the tree. There are many uses for that poplar tree.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then there is the big tooth aspen. I don't remember hearing any uses for this one. I do remember hearing something from the old time Anishinaabe. It was when spring was approaching. Everyone would wait for the birch bark to be ready to be peeled so they could make their things out of birch bark. There was this one lady, my aunt, that is now deceased, that told me this. You should study the big tooth aspen. When the aspen has finished growing leaves, this is how you will know. That is when the bark is ready; that is when you will go and look it when the aspen is finished growing leaves, this tree really has big leaves. I can't say the name of it â big tooth, something.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>The basswood, that is yet another one. And then this one called basswood, wiigop, is also what it is called this tree called basswood and this one is very â there are many uses for the basswood when one peels the bark of the tree. I still do this today. After you peel the top bark, then you peel the layers off in strips. (After I peeled the bark), I studied the sticks from this tree this summer, and I learned that it was very light. It was very light when it got dried. And so I made my rice knockers out of them. They are very light and smooth. I did not even need to carve it. I only had to sharpen it at one end; the wood is very light. There are probably many other uses for this medicine tree that is called basswood (in English).</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And there is the speckled alder. It grows in lower brush area that alder. That too has many uses. Someone once told me this â to use this tree when something is wrong with a child, when the child suffers from a diaper rash, but I would not go into detail how it is used. (I am not at liberty to discuss how this is done.) There are special protocols before someone does things like making medicine. This is what I was told. Seek out someone's advice when you do something in a sacred manner, especially when tobacco is offered. Some offer food before cutting down a tree. This one too has its special use. Speckled elder is what it is called. This is what I was also told about this moon that is called throw-sickness-away-moon. You may have a different name for it. As for me I use the moon that is named the crows-return-moon, (March). That is it how I taught my children as I watched them grow. This is the way I was taught, too. The-throw-away-sickness-moon one, that is when you will use the speckled alder tree. Choose one that is old and almost falling apart. That is the one that you use to throw with, at the moon that is up in the sky. This is when you tell her (the moon) what you are throwing away. "I am throwing it away." Sometimes perhaps someone will throw away their sickness, or they could throw away their anger and anything that is plaguing you. This is what they tell the moon, to take the sickness away, "I do not want it to bother me anymore" is what someone will sometimes say. Use the wood that is almost falling apart, that is what I was told. That is what one would throw to the moon, the moon that at night (in the heavens). It is then that your sickness or your sorrow is taken from you. So that is what one use that I heard how it is used, this one called the speckled alder.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Red willow. This is yet another one, a great medicine tree. Apparently the red willow said, "The Anishinaabe that are going to arrive will have many uses for me. They will come to know or perhaps they will come to dream of how to use these things." And then again as for me I, too, know about this one. This red willow I use when I make little birch bark baskets. I use them to sew on the trimmings, so that it can secure/reinforce around the birch bark basket, also when one makes a winnowing basket or when wild rice is winnowed. That is the part I use, the willow part. It bends/curves nicely. It bends/curves very well when one uses it. Also that one, they are all like thatâ¦ they are all medicine trees, the whole lot of them.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Then there is one thing that I know of â the way that I use it when I was a child. This tree had hazelnuts growing on them. They are round/ball-like nuts. Probably hazel nut is what they are called in English. We use to gather them when we were children, and we ate them by breaking open the shell. This is how we got our food, how we ate by going around collecting hazelnuts. There is a lot of ways that you can use that. I've heard of many ways of how the medicine people use this tree. They use it in a lot of ways. That is why it is called hazelnut tree because hazelnuts grow on there.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Pin cherry. This too is another one with medicine. There are a lot of berries growing on it. My grandmother used to tell me to gather up the berries. She used to make something out of it. She made it into tea. "Here take a drink of this," she said to me. This must be her medicine water; however, I did not ask her what it was for. I had a lot of respect for my grandmother, and whatever she told me, that is what I did.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then there is the choke cherry tree. That tree has choke cherries growing on it. I have a lot of uses for that tree. Once I made choke cherry jelly with those choke cherries. That jam tastes really good. That tree is also a great medicine tree.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Juniper. This is another one of the needled trees.  Wherever it is a smooth rocky area is where this can be seen. This is what the white man calls juniper. Again this one has many good uses also. All the trees that we see have many uses for them.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Sumac (pipe stem tree).  And then there is this another one. This one grows all over the place. As children we would eat the things that grew on this tree. They taste really good. I am not sure what they are called, They look like little red berries. I think the white-man calls it sumac. This is where the pipe stem is made from. When someone makes a pipe, this is where the stem is made from.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>We know what to do when we are doing these things. No one should cut down a tree for no reason. Only if one has a purpose for it. That is what I was told not to do. Do not cut down a tree without a purpose. Only if you have a reason to use it like making medicine or if one were to make a pipe stem. It is the same as when you use the alder. Even though the tree is rotten or falling orâ¦ You should do something for the tree. You should also honor the tree and tell it why you are cutting it down. This is what I was always told. They are someone. (They are people.  They are alive.) All the trees that you see standing, all of them are someone. That is someone that is standing. It also has a name. That is why you show respect to it. You do not cut it down for no reason. This is what I was told; you should have respect for all things.</em>
