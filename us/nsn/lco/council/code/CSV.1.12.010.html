                  <p>Mitigoog Teaching by Ogimaawigwanebiik (Nancy Jones) from Dibaajimowinan: Anishinaabe Stories of Culture and Respect, Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WI: July 2013. </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Now this tree with needles, the one called white spruce – oops! I just remembered.  First I need to talk about this. All these trees we see in the bush have Indian names. Nanibosh gave them all Indian names when he made the earth. And that is why, that is what I tell them, people. It is very sacred when someone has a spirit name. That is why we were given Anishinaabe names. The spirit gave these to us. The spirit gave us these names so that we can carry them in a sacred manner. That is why they were so sacred, highly honored. That is why. That is how one receives good life when they take care of or honor their name. This is what my late grandmother told to me. If you think about those trees, they all have spirit names. That is why you have a spirit name. This is what my grandmother told me.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>This is what Nanaboozhoo did; he gave all trees names. That is the white spruce that was named. There are a lot of uses for the white spruce. So he (the tree) was asked (by Nanabush), “How are you going to help the Anishinaabe when they get here?” “Oh there is a lot they can use me for,” he said. “They might even make medicine out of me; they can use my tree-ness and my needles.” “Spruce” apparently is what he is called in the English, when one here to use the English language that is what the white people (French) call them. And I have this one teaching, one of the ways I use the white spruce -when the moose is killed. And this, a certain intestine part of the moose has inside of him, that is what I used. That white spruce, I shrink it (using heat and smoke). I turned it inside out, that certain part of the intestine.  And then I heated up the intestine. I made a fire. And then I put that spruce there. Then on top of that smoky spruce I put that moose intestine to shrink. Does it ever taste good when you do it this way.  (Cultural point. The moose is pleased when all of his parts are eaten. Every part of the moose has a special gift for the woman who is the life giver.)</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then there is the next one. The cedar tree, that was another one that was asked, “How will you help the Anishinaabe?” Nanabosh asked. “Oh there are a lot of ways I can help the Anishinaabe,” he said. “When somebody has a child, when a couple has a child, they will use my wood to make the cradle board,” he said. "I will give him all the love that I have to offer to the child. I shall bestow many visions onto him for the duration that he is in the cradle board. And he shall dream too. The child will have healthy bones, have a straight spine, strong and straight bones just be totally healthy if one uses the cedar. I have many uses that I can give them, when they want to make medicine from my being a tree. When someone is making a canoe, that is one use that will be used to make the strips of cedar on the bottom when someone makes it. They can make a cedar bark covering for their shelter when they want to stay warm during the winter". That is the one, the cedar bark, that will be utilized for a roof covering. And also these trees they will make other things like rice knockers, how it was said. This is where it will come from. "There are many ways I can help the Anishinaabe. I shall care for them too.”</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Next I will talk about the jackpPine. I will also help. That whom they call the jack pine, perhaps is what he is called. "Oh me too, I could help out the Anishinaabe. Me too! I have medicine that the Anishinaabe could use." They will learn more about it (as the world grows.) There is something, one thing, I would like to tell about. For instance these certain partridges the ones called spruce hens. It is these [jackpine] boughs that these spruce hens eat. That is where the Anishinaabe looked for them to go get when he wanted to eat the spruce hen, it is said. The spruce hen is very tame.  "And that is the way I will try to help the Anishinaabe." They are easy to snare the spruce hen whenever they use a snare (on a long stick.) “That is the way that I shall help the Anishinaabe.” (Cultural note: The jack pine instructed the spruce hen to make himself available to the Anishinaabe. The spruce hen is not dumb. The jack pine promised Nenabosh that he would help the Anishinaabe, and this is how he is keeping his promise.)</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Then next the balsam tree arrived. It is the balsam tree which is called this way. “Oh me too, I shall help in many ways. For instance, when the Anishinaabe makes camp. They will use my boughs as a floor when they need something to lie on. And for instance these things, the way that I look, (my pitch) it is.  If someone pokes at the lumpy pitch, the blister part of that tree, from there they will get medicine. The medicine they will get from here, and they know later on how to use this medicine. There is a reason why I look like this, when the tree has all this sticky pitch. There are many uses for this (pitch.) They will use this for flooring, and others will use this when they make medicine. They will have dreams as to how to use it, those Anishinaabeg when they arrive.”</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And there is another one, the next one. The white pine, the one they call white pine, is what they named it. I did not hear of many uses for this tree. However, it burns very well when used as firewood this pine tree.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then the next one, he is like the others, too. He, too, is medicinal. All the trees that grow there, they are all medicinal trees. It is only – someone will come to know how – how a person would utilize this tree, how it be would used. This is what I was told when I was being instructed in something. You will live and learn about it. Now look at this [red] pine. It is the same this one, when I used to see that tree. When they used to split it up in little pieces (with an ax), and they would saw it up. We used to make play things out of it when we were children. We would bend the needles to make little snowshoes – little snow shoes just like when a child is at play. That is what we did.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Then another one spoke up. “Me too! I carry medicine. Later on the Anishinaabeg will know how to use me,” the tree said. And now that white birch tree, he, too, has many uses. This is where a variety of things are made from. For example, as far back as I can remember, I would watch my late father. He would make snowshoes by bending that birch tree. He also made a toboggan. And when he used the bark, he made many things with it. Also the folding birch bark basket, it was said. Also when the Anishinaabe needed something for roofing. I do not remember what it is called (wiigwaasabak), when they sew the birch bark (pieces) together. That is what one would use for roofing material long ago,  even nowadays whenever one wants to make a roof. That is the birch tree that I am talking about.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And now for the poplar tree. Poplar tree is probably the name of it. And he too spoke up.“I too have many gifts to help the Anishinaabe.” For example when the way that my tree looks and even the smaller trees, this is where the Anishinaabe will get medicine from when they make medicine.” I also remember back when I was a child. We would eat the sap from the bark from the poplar tree. We would peel the bark of the tree. This is where we would get it from. Boy, did it ever taste good that one! It was called thick sap. It almost tastse like sugar. That is what we use to go after, later on into the summer. I, we, really liked the taste of it and this is what my late grandmother told me. “You are medicating yourselves when you eat that sap. That is medicine that you are eating” is what she use to tell me. I really liked what she said to me. I would hang out in the woods eating the sap of the tree. There are many uses for that poplar tree.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then there is the big tooth aspen. I don’t remember hearing any uses for this one. I do remember hearing something from the old time Anishinaabe. It was when spring was approaching. Everyone would wait for the birch bark to be ready to be peeled so they could make their things out of birch bark. There was this one lady, my aunt, that is now deceased, that told me this. You should study the big tooth aspen. When the aspen has finished growing leaves, this is how you will know. That is when the bark is ready; that is when you will go and look it when the aspen is finished growing leaves, this tree really has big leaves. I can't say the name of it – big tooth, something.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>The basswood, that is yet another one. And then this one called basswood, wiigop, is also what it is called this tree called basswood and this one is very – there are many uses for the basswood when one peels the bark of the tree. I still do this today. After you peel the top bark, then you peel the layers off in strips. (After I peeled the bark), I studied the sticks from this tree this summer, and I learned that it was very light. It was very light when it got dried. And so I made my rice knockers out of them. They are very light and smooth. I did not even need to carve it. I only had to sharpen it at one end; the wood is very light. There are probably many other uses for this medicine tree that is called basswood (in English).</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And there is the speckled alder. It grows in lower brush area that alder. That too has many uses. Someone once told me this – to use this tree when something is wrong with a child, when the child suffers from a diaper rash, but I would not go into detail how it is used. (I am not at liberty to discuss how this is done.) There are special protocols before someone does things like making medicine. This is what I was told. Seek out someone’s advice when you do something in a sacred manner, especially when tobacco is offered. Some offer food before cutting down a tree. This one too has its special use. Speckled elder is what it is called. This is what I was also told about this moon that is called throw-sickness-away-moon. You may have a different name for it. As for me I use the moon that is named the crows-return-moon, (March). That is it how I taught my children as I watched them grow. This is the way I was taught, too. The-throw-away-sickness-moon one, that is when you will use the speckled alder tree. Choose one that is old and almost falling apart. That is the one that you use to throw with, at the moon that is up in the sky. This is when you tell her (the moon) what you are throwing away. “I am throwing it away.” Sometimes perhaps someone will throw away their sickness, or they could throw away their anger and anything that is plaguing you. This is what they tell the moon, to take the sickness away, “I do not want it to bother me anymore” is what someone will sometimes say. Use the wood that is almost falling apart, that is what I was told. That is what one would throw to the moon, the moon that at night (in the heavens). It is then that your sickness or your sorrow is taken from you. So that is what one use that I heard how it is used, this one called the speckled alder.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Red willow. This is yet another one, a great medicine tree. Apparently the red willow said, “The Anishinaabe that are going to arrive will have many uses for me. They will come to know or perhaps they will come to dream of how to use these things.” And then again as for me I, too, know about this one. This red willow I use when I make little birch bark baskets. I use them to sew on the trimmings, so that it can secure/reinforce around the birch bark basket, also when one makes a winnowing basket or when wild rice is winnowed. That is the part I use, the willow part. It bends/curves nicely. It bends/curves very well when one uses it. Also that one, they are all like that… they are all medicine trees, the whole lot of them.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Then there is one thing that I know of – the way that I use it when I was a child. This tree had hazelnuts growing on them. They are round/ball-like nuts. Probably hazel nut is what they are called in English. We use to gather them when we were children, and we ate them by breaking open the shell. This is how we got our food, how we ate by going around collecting hazelnuts. There is a lot of ways that you can use that. I’ve heard of many ways of how the medicine people use this tree. They use it in a lot of ways. That is why it is called hazelnut tree because hazelnuts grow on there.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Pin cherry. This too is another one with medicine. There are a lot of berries growing on it. My grandmother used to tell me to gather up the berries. She used to make something out of it. She made it into tea. “Here take a drink of this,” she said to me. This must be her medicine water; however, I did not ask her what it was for. I had a lot of respect for my grandmother, and whatever she told me, that is what I did.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>And then there is the choke cherry tree. That tree has choke cherries growing on it. I have a lot of uses for that tree. Once I made choke cherry jelly with those choke cherries. That jam tastes really good. That tree is also a great medicine tree.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Juniper. This is another one of the needled trees.  Wherever it is a smooth rocky area is where this can be seen. This is what the white man calls juniper. Again this one has many good uses also. All the trees that we see have many uses for them.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Sumac (pipe stem tree).  And then there is this another one. This one grows all over the place. As children we would eat the things that grew on this tree. They taste really good. I am not sure what they are called, They look like little red berries. I think the white-man calls it sumac. This is where the pipe stem is made from. When someone makes a pipe, this is where the stem is made from.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>We know what to do when we are doing these things. No one should cut down a tree for no reason. Only if one has a purpose for it. That is what I was told not to do. Do not cut down a tree without a purpose. Only if you have a reason to use it like making medicine or if one were to make a pipe stem. It is the same as when you use the alder. Even though the tree is rotten or falling or… You should do something for the tree. You should also honor the tree and tell it why you are cutting it down. This is what I was always told. They are someone. (They are people.  They are alive.) All the trees that you see standing, all of them are someone. That is someone that is standing. It also has a name. That is why you show respect to it. You do not cut it down for no reason. This is what I was told; you should have respect for all things.</em>
