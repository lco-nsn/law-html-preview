                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>§CSV.1.3.290 was formerly codified as VI LCOTCL §1.329</p>
                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p><strong><em>Niiyawe’enh</em></strong> – refers to <em>niiyaw</em> (body) which carries the critical meaning of the word for namesake. When someone gave a name, the name giver gave part of his or her spirit essence and put it into the body of the name recipient, making them spiritually related for life. The name giver then functioned more like a godparent in Christian tradition, as a spiritually connected family member blessed with the same dream or vision that informed the given name. The term niiyawe’enh is used reciprocally and is shortened in some communities to just <em>we’enh</em>, but still retaining the cultural and spiritual value. Sources for information on naming include: Anton Treuer, <em>The Assassination of Hole in the Day</em>, (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2010), pg. 13; Edward Benton-Benai, <em>The Mishomis Book: The Voice of the Ojibway</em>, (Hayward, WI: Indian Country Communications, Inc., 1988), Chapter 2, Original Man Walks the Earth, pgs. 5-9; Basil Johnston, <em>Ojibway Heritage</em>, (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), Chapter 11, Ceremonies, Songs and Dances (Life Commemorations), pgs. 141-148; Basil Johnston, Ojibway Ceremonies, (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), “The Naming Ceremony: Wauweendaussowin,” pgs. 11-30; Frances Densmore, <em>Chippewa Customs</em>, Washington: Bulletin, Bureau of American Ethnology, 1929), “The Naming of a Child,” pgs. 52-58; Amik Larry Smallwood, <em>Ojibwe Names are Spirit Names</em>, (Onamia,MN: Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, 2009), pgs. 1-2. </p>
                  <p><strong><em>Doodem</em></strong> – refers to <em>ode’</em> (heart) and <em>doodoosh</em> (from where one gets their sustenance) which establishes the word for clan. Ojibwe stories commonly acknowledge animals as teachers and guides to Original Man, or Anishinaabe. They taught him many valuable lessons as he became acquainted with his environment. They showed him various plants for use as food, medicine, in ceremonies and for utilitarian purposes. They showed him how to hunt and fish and most important of all, they provided themselves to Anishinaabe for food, clothing, and shelter. The Ojibwe at one time were not relating to <em>aki</em>, the earth in a way that properly accounted for these pre-existing relationships. They had created great imbalance and the Earth was flooded. When the Earth was created anew, the animals stood up for the people, they vouched for the Ojibwe and said they would teach them how to relate to creation. The animals created a relationship with the Ojibwe and took responsibility for their actions. This is one of the origin stories of the <em>doodem</em> (clan) system. This system uses various animals as symbols for the clans. The animals’ characteristics provide an identity and define roles and responsibilities for members of each <em>doodem</em>. The <em>Doodem</em> becomes another form of family for Ojibwe people. <em>Doodem</em> identity is passed through the father. Members of the same <em>doodem</em>, no matter how many miles apart, were one’s brothers and sisters and were expected to extend hospitality, food and lodging to each other. Since Ojibwe people belong to a tribe (band) and to the Ojibwe Nation, <em>doodem</em> relationships help unite the various Ojibwe tribes as one nation. Sources for information on clans include: Edward Benton-Benai, <em>The Mishomis Book: The Voice of the Ojibway</em>, (Hayward, WI: Indian Country Communications, Inc., 1988), Chapter 10, The Clan System, pgs. 74-78; Ruth Landes, <em>Ojibwa Sociology</em>, (NY: Columbia University Contributions to Anthropology, 1969), Chapter 2, “Gens Organization,” pgs. 31-52; William W. Warren, <em>History of the Ojibway People</em>, (St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1984), Chapter 2, “Totemic Division of the Ojibways,” pgs. 41-53; Basil Johnston, <em>Ojibway Heritage</em>, (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), Chapter 5, “Man’s World,” pgs. 59-79; James Dumont, <em>Anishinaabe Izhichigewin</em>, (1999), Chapter 1, Part Four “The Anishinaabe Clan System as a Model of Governance,” pgs. 27-36, Chapter 1, Part Five, “Anishinaabe Principles of Leadership and Managing Change,” pgs. 36-42; Heidi Bohaker, “Reading Anishinaabe Identities: Meaning and Metaphor in Nindoodem Pictographs,” <em>Ethnohistory</em>, vol. 57, no. 1 (Winter 2010): 11-33; Heidi Bohaker, “Nindoodemag: The Signifigance of Algonquian Kinship Networks in the Eastern Great Lakes Region, 1600-1701,” <em>William and Mary Quarterly</em>, vol. 63, no. 1 (January 2006): 23-49.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>Bami’aagaan</em></strong> – refers to <em>bami’</em> (provide for, nurture, look after, support, adopt) which establishes the word for the adopted one. Customary adoption is a traditional tribal practice recognized by the community and tribe which acknowledges a person as having established a permanent kinship relationship such as parent/child, brother/sister, or grandparent/grandchild, with someone other than the person’s blood relative. It is the fundamental belief of the Ojibwe that the people of the communities are the sacred responsibility of the Tribe. This is because one of the basic inherent sovereign rights of the Tribe is the right to make decisions regarding the best interests of their communities including who should provide for the care, nourishment and support of their members. This provision is intended to acknowledge these safe, stable, nurturing, and permanent relationships established pursuant to tribal customary practices regarding the tribe’s members in order to provide for the protection of their people and way of life. The principles that guide decisions pertaining to <em>bami’aagan</em> are: protection of the member’s well-being and welfare and their sense of belonging; preservation of the member’s identity as a tribal member and member of an extended family and clan; as well as the preservation of the culture, religion, language, values, clan system and relationships of the Tribe. Sources for information on traditional kinship responsibilities and customary adoption include: White Earth Band of Ojibwe, <em>Title 4(a) Customary Adoption Code</em>; Ruth Landes, <em>Ojibwa Sociology</em>, (NY: Columbia University Contributions to Anthropology, 1969), Chapter 2, “Kinship Organization,” pgs. 5-30; Heidi Kiiwetinipinesiik Stark, “Marked by Fire: Anishinaabe Articulations of Nationhood in Treaty Making with the United States and Canada,” <em>American Indian Quarterly</em>, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 119-149.</p>
