                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to protect and preserve the sovereign immunity of the Tribe, to define the entities and individuals entitled to the protection of such immunity, and to specify the manner in which such immunity may be waived, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(s)" title="">Article V, § 1(s) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians</a>, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "To promulgate and enforce ordinances…providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice…" Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby recognizes that Tribal sovereign immunity, as defined in numerous federal court decisions, is an inherent and indispensable aspect of Tribal sovereignty. The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians also recognizes that Tribal sovereign immunity affords necessary protection of Tribal resources, and necessary protection for Tribal officers, employees, and agents in both governmental and commercial settings.</p>

                  <p>Nothing but a final judgment or order may be appealed. If an order in a case leaves other matters to be decided, and does not completely settle all disputed issues between the parties, so that the Tribal Court still has work to do, then the order is not final and an appeal cannot be filed. In cases involving multiple parties, an order or judgment may dispose of all issues between two or more of the parties, and would therefore be appealable. In cases involving multiple issues, an order disposing of one or more issues may leave others as yet unresolved and would therefore not be appealable.</p>

                  <p>The essence of the notice of appeal is to give fair notice to the other parties that what would otherwise be a final disposition of a case at the tribal court level will not be final, and to allow the other parties to begin preparation for responding to the appeal or for filing a cross-appeal.

                  <p>The above rules are considered the minimum necessary for allowing the Court of Appeals to conduct its business in an efficient and just fashion. Briefing rules are purposely looser than in other jurisdictions to allow non-lawyers to represent themselves, or if otherwise permitted by the rules of the Tribal Court (see <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/TCT.2" title="Chapter TCT.2 Rules of Civil Procedure Code of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians">Chapter TCT.2</a>), to represent others. Briefs are made optional, in recognition that some self-represented parties may not wish to file briefs but may rather wish to present their cases solely in oral argument. The notice of appeal [see Sec. 2.9(a)] accordingly requires a short statement of the grounds for appeal and of the relief sought. A party may or may not be disadvantaged by failure to file a brief.</p>

                  <h4>Commentary</h4>
                  <p>The standard of review defines the relationship between the trial court and the appeals court. The standard of review seeks to allocate to each court that part of the judicial work which it can best do. The trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility and is therefore sustained on such matters unless its findings are clearly erroneous. The trial court is in no better position to interpret the law than the appeals court; in fact, the appeals court has the luxury of being able to analyze the law away from the heat of trial and can better perform this task itself. The appeals court can therefore look at questions of law afresh and need not defer at all to the trial court. Discretionary questions by their nature can result in different decisions when put to different decision makers. The function of the appeals court in reviewing a discretionary decision is not to decide the result it would choose, but to determine whether the trial court in fact exercised discretion and made a decision based on the applicable facts and law. The exercise of discretion is more than bald decision-making and it is the task of the appeals court to see that the appropriate process was followed.</p>
                  <p>Specific instances of common standard of review problems are listed in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/TCT.3.4.050" title="TCT.3.4.050 Standard of Review">this section</a>; for instance the definition of sentencing as a discretionary determination. These instances are not exclusive. The Tribal Governing Board may provide by ordinance and the courts by decision the classification of other matters as factual, legal, or discretionary.</p>

                  <h4>Commentary</h4>
                  <p>Subsections (a) and (d) preserve the basic function of the appeals court as a court of review, not a court of initial determination. The trial court should have the first opportunity to consider all issues in litigation and to see that the record is fully developed.</p>

                  <p><a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/TCT.3.4.070#(c)" title="">Section TCT.3.4.070(c)</a> states the principle that a court will not decide issues over which there is no current controversy. The controversy that existed during trial may be over by the time of appeal. The exception to this rule is the type of case that may occur again but is likely never to survive long enough to receive appellate review. For instance, an individual may wish to challenge a court's suspension of his hunting and fishing rights for a period of three months, but by the completion of the appellate briefing schedule the suspension would be ended and the case moot. Since the issue could recur, but would always become moot before it was ready for decision, the mootness doctrine would be set aside.</p>
