                  <strong>Preamble</strong>
                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to promote the traditional value that children are the most important asset of the Tribe, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(h)" title="">Article V, § 1 (h) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians</a> empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "engage in any business that will further the social or economic well-being of members of the Band or undertake any programs or projects designed for the economic advancement of the people" and pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(j)" title="">Article V, §1(j)</a> "to administer any funds within  the control of the Band; to make expenditures from available funds for public purposes…All expenditures by the Governing Board shall be in accord with a previously approved budget, and the amount so paid shall be a matter of public record at all times." As such the Tribal Governing Board adopts this Ordinance to memorialize and confirm existing procedures used in the administration of general welfare assistance programs and services and is not to be construed as the creation of new general welfare assistance rights that previously did not exist. Assistance provided prior to the enactment of this Ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed as general welfare assistance pursuant to the authority of the Tribal Constitution. It is intended to establish a framework to improve the coordination of general welfare doctrine compliance. Programs and Services referred to herein must be authorized by independent action of the Tribe or its designees.</p>

                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(h)" title="">Article V, § 1 (h)</a> and (j) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "engage in any business that will further the social or economic well-being of members of the Band or undertake any programs or projects designed for the economic advancement of the people" and pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/constitution/Constitution/V/1#(j)" title="">Article V, §1(j)</a> "to administer any funds within  the control of the Band; to make expenditures from available funds for public purposes…All expenditures by the Governing Board shall be in accord with a previously approved budget, and the amount so paid shall be a matter of public record at all times." On September 18, 2014, the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 passed both houses of Congress, and was signed into law on September 29, 2014. The Tribal Governing Board now expressly embraces the forgoing principles as an integral part of this Ordinance and as guiding principles in construing the Tribe's compliance with Code Section 139E, the Safe Harbor Rules, and the General Test. The assistance payments and services authorized by this Ordinance are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the general welfare doctrine to the fullest extent permitted by law and shall be construed accordingly.</p>

Such purposes may include, for example, and not by way of limitation, assistance for medical care, food, shelter, health, education, subsistence, housing, elder and disabled care, assistance to meet cultural, traditional and religious needs of the Tribe and its membership, and assistance to promote self-sufficiency, self-determination, Tribal image, entrepreneurship, and the employment of Tribal Members.
