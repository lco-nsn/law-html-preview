                <p>If an Employee is dissatisfied with the medical treatment offered by the primary physician and/or approved referral physician, the Employee shall submit a written statement to the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider indicating the dissatisfaction and the reasons for it. Based on this statement, an agreement may be reached between the Employee and the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider to permit the Employee to seek an alternative Health Care Provider. The following conditions shall also apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(4)(a)">(a)</span> The Employee must receive prior approval from the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider before receiving any treatment/service from the alternate medical provider chosen by the Employee.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Examination of Claims</p>
                <p>Whenever an injured Employee claims compensation, the Employee must submit to an <em>Independent Medical Examination/Evaluation (IME),</em> or second opinion, when requested by the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider. The Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider may schedule an Employee for an <em>Independent Medical Examination</em> or evaluation at any time during the Employee's course of medical treatment. The expense for this service, except expense for child care, will be paid by the Plan.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> Temporary Total Disability</p>
                <p>Benefits are payable when the disability results solely from a bodily injury arising in and out of the course of employment with the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Government. The benefits are calculated as sixty-seven (67%) of the weekly wage of the Employee at the time of the injury, and subject to a maximum of $450.00 per week. The daily wage will be calculated by using the average of the prior 26 work weeks. Disability benefits are paid only if the disability is evidenced by medical opinion based on examination and treatment rendered at the time of the claimed disability and requires an Independent Medical Examination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> Temporary Partial Disability</p>
                <p>This benefit represents sixty-seven (67%) of the difference between the pre-injury weekly wage and weekly wage the Employee earns after returning to light duty restricted modified work if the wage loss is due solely to the injury and disability suffered while in the course and scope of the employment with the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Government. Temporary partial disability benefits are subject to the same maximums and restrictions as temporary total disability benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(8)">(8)</span> Permanent Partial Disability</p>
                <p>This benefit will compensate the injured Employee for any permanent loss/loss of use of a body part suffered as a result of compensable bodily injury. The designated percentage of the disability rating is multiplied by the weekly permanent disability benefit, which determines the dollar amount payable to the Employee and is allocated in one lump sum. Permanent partial disability benefits are not payable concurrently with temporary total/temporary partial benefits. To determine Permanent Partial Disability the health care provider must use the American Medical Association's "Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Partial Impairment,'' 5<sup>th</sup> Edition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(9)">(9)</span> Waiting Period</p>
                <p>For All Employees: Vacation or sick time benefits may be used for the first three (3) scheduled days lost. When verified that the Employee's claim is a legitimate work related claim and the employee is off work for ten or more calendar days, compensation is payable beginning with the first day of disability. Vacation and sick time benefits may be reconciled if used.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(10)">(10)</span> Dependency Benefits</p>
                <p>If an Employee dies from a work related injury or illness leaving a legal spouse and/or dependent child/children, the Employer shall make payments to the legal spouse and/or dependent child/children in an amount equal to sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Employee's average weekly wage at the time of the Employees injury or illness to a maximum of $450.00 per week. This amount will be evenly distributed to the surviving issue, if the legal spouse is deceased.</p>
                <p>As determined by the Plan Administrator, payments to the legal spouse shall be for a maximum of one (1) year, terminating upon the remarriage or death of the spouse, whichever comes first. Payments to a dependent child/children shall be made until the dependent child/children reaches the age of 18 unless the dependent child/children is a full-time student or determined by medical evidence to be physically or mentally incapable of self-support, in which case payment shall be made to age 25.</p>
