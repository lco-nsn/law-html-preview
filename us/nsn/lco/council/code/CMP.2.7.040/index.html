A Licensee may charge and collect interest in respect of a Loan at such daily, weekly, monthly, annual, or other periodic percentage rate or rates as the agreement governing the Loan provides or as established in the manner provided in such agreement and may calculate such interest by way of simple interest or such other method as the agreement governing the Loan provides.  If the interest is precomputed it may be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due. For purposes hereof, a year may but need not be a calendar year and may be such period of from 360 to 366 days, including or disregarding leap year, as the Licensee may determine.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <u>Variable Rates</u>.  If the agreement governing the Loan so provides, the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest charged and collected in respect of the Loan may, if the interest is not precomputed and taken in advance, vary in accordance with a schedule or formula.  Such periodic percentage rate or rates may vary from time to time as the rate determined in accordance with such schedule or formula varies and such periodic percentage rate or rates, as so varied, may be made applicable to all or any part of outstanding unpaid amounts of such Loan on and after the effective date of such variation.  <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/CMP.2.7.040" title="CMP.2.7.040 Consumer Financial Services: General Terms">This section</a> shall not be construed to limit the authority of a Licensee to charge and collect interest in respect of a Loan in the manner and at the rate or rates authorized in any other Section of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/CMP.2.7" title="Subchapter CMP.2.7 Authorized Consumer Financial Services">this subchapter</a>.  Without limitation, a permissible schedule or formula hereunder may include provisions in the agreement governing the Loan for a change in the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest applicable to all or any part of outstanding unpaid amounts whether by variation of the then applicable periodic percentage rate or rates of interest, variation of an index or margin or otherwise, contingent upon the happening of any event or circumstance specified in the Loan agreement, which event or circumstance may include the failure of the Consumer to perform in accordance with the terms of the Loan agreement.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(B)">(B)</span> If the agreement governing a Loan so provides, a License may impose, as interest, a late or delinquency charge upon any outstanding unpaid installment payments or portions thereof under the Loan agreement which are in default; provided, however, that no more than 1 such delinquency charge may be imposed in respect of any single such installment payment or portion thereof regardless of the period during which it remains in default.  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall limit, restrict, or otherwise affect the right of a Licensee under and pursuant to Â§ 2.702 (5) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/CMP.2.7" title="Subchapter CMP.2.7 Authorized Consumer Financial Services">this subchapter</a> to change the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest applicable to the Loan agreement between the Licensee and a Consumer upon the occurrence of a delinquency or default or other failure of the Consumer to perform in accordance with the terms of the Loan agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Such other charges as are set forth in the Agreement governing the Loan including, but not limited to, costs, fees, services, points, premiums and all other reasonable expenses which may be incurred by such Applicant in connection with a Loan.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(A)">(A)</span> A Licensee may elect to charge an administrative fee to the Consumer for inventory management or other costs, which fee shall not exceed the lesser of $100 or 20 percent (20%) of the ascribed value of the leased good or goods, and minimum rentals based upon the first 45 days of the lease in the event the lessee terminates the lease.  These charges to not constitute penalties.  A fixed price purchase option in a lease does not of itself create a security interest.  This is particularly true if the fixed price is substantial in relation to the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.  Other prices are also sufficient provided they are not nominal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> <u>Deferred Installments</u>.  A Licensee may at any time or from time to time permit a Consumer to defer installment payments of a Loan and may, in connection with such deferral, charge and collect deferral charges.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> <u>Attorney's Fees; Costs</u>.  In the event a Consumer defaults under the terms of a Loan, the Licensee may, if the Consumer's account is referred to an attorney (not a regularly salaried employee of the Licensee) or to a third party for collection and, if the agreement governing, or the bond, note or other evidence of, the Loan so provides, charge and collect from the Consumer a reasonable attorney's fee.  In addition, following a Consumer's default, the Licensee may, if the agreement governing, or the bond, note or other evidence of, the Loan so provides, recover from the Consumer all court, alternative dispute resolution or other collection costs (including, without limitation, fees, and charges of collection agencies) actually incurred by the Licensee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> <u>No Oral Agreements</u>.
