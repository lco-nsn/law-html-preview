Team members are required to use their available PTO for the absence(s) prior to utilizing any loaned PTO.  All PTO hours received as a loan shall be repaid at 50% of their accrual rate, on a weekly basis, beginning the following week that the loan was received.   A maximum of 40 hours can be received as a loan once per calendar year.  An additional loan is not allowed until all previous loan amounts have been paid back.</p>
